# The-LineUp

## Intro -
Hello... This is the place to mark your tasks and check them once done.

## Problem Statement - 
In college there are a lot of tasks to take care of. To ensure proper completion of every task before the deadline we need to manage all of them well. A to-do list helps us to keep track of our pending and completed tasks. It also refrains us from forgetting them. Both Jojo and Dodo have the to-do list and they are happy to do all of the tasks before deadline.

## Basic Features - 
- [x] An input field for the date (that will be the deadline of the task added). 
- [x] Pending and completed tasks should be distinguishable.
- [x] The user can delete the task. (by clicking on the delete icon)
- [x] The top of the page shall show a quote that will change after every refresh. (You may use any API for this, for example:- Link) 

## Advanced Features -
- [x] Sort the task according to the deadline or date when the user added the task. 
- [ ] Add image functionality in addition to the name of the task.
